    "1. Explain the Properties of the F-Distribution?\n",
    "The F-distribution has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-negativity: Values of the F-distribution are always non-negative because it's based on variance ratios.\n",
    "Asymmetry: The F-distribution is right-skewed, especially when degrees of freedom (df) are small, but the skewness reduces as df increase.\n",
    "Degrees of Freedom Dependence: The shape of the F-distribution depends on two sets of degrees of freedomâ€”one for the numerator and one for the denominator.\n",
    "Mean and Mode: The mean of an F-distribution is approximately 1 if the numerator and denominator degrees of freedom are large. The mode, however, is typically less than 1.\n",
    "Variance: The variance of the F-distribution depends on the degrees of freedom and becomes smaller as df increase."
